# AsciiPaint

## Disclaimer
This project was first made in TypeScript.
Itw orked quite well, but due to the way the command is handeled and the fixed types in Java, this structure couldn't be reproduced as sucessfully as in the previous project.

Due to these small problems, the program works but may be unstable.
I've preferred to improve stability rather than adding test methods (i know my methods are working quite well tho).
